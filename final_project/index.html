	<p>The nymph is considered to be the most productive of all of the flies to use to fly fish for trout due to the fact that fish, trout specifically, feed approximately 80% of the time underwater.  And that is just how you fish the nymph, under the surface of the water.

	The nymph is one of the stages of insects such as the mayfly, caddis, or stonefly.  As with most insects, they transform through various different stages until they reach the end of their life-cycle.  The nymph is the stage in which the insects live their lives under the surface of the water, along the stream beds, in the lake bottom, an other such areas.  Because of this, they become very abundant for the fish to feed on.  That is precisely why trout feed primarily on these types of insects.</p>

		<p>Wet-fly fishing is at least 2,000 years old and for centuries was the primary method for catching trout with the long rod. Yet with so many new-age patterns vying for your attention in today’s fly cases, it’s easy to forget that a partridge-and-orange soft hackle catches trout as well now as it did hundreds of years ago.

		Whereas nymphing covers the bottom foot of the water column, and dry-fly fishing happens on top, wet flies can be fished anywhere in the water column and can mimic a vast amount of forage. Even when there’s no sign of hatch activity or feeding fish, I’m confident I’ll catch trout with wet flies. If there is a hatch, I know I might lose count of my fish. With an understanding of wet-fly theory, you’ll catch far more trout with a fly rod than you ever thought possible.</p>
